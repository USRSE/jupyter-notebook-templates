    "    \"These recommendations are based on [6]\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1. Tell a story for an audience: interleave explanatory text with code and results to create a computational narrative.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2. Document the process, not just the results: so that others, and yourself later, will understand your reasoning and choices.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"3. Use cell divisions to make steps clear: have eaach cell perform one meaningful and documented step, avoid long cells.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"4. Modularize code: use and document functions for repeated operations to make the code more readable and save space.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"5. Record dependencies: use pip or Conda package manager, with environment.yml (Conda) or requirements.txt (pip). Please indicate package versions explicitly. Ideally, include a listing of dependencies at the bottom of the notebook. Make sure you test your notebook in an environment created from these dependencies, so that you don't add undocumened dependencies.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"6. Use version control: https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime is a diffing tool specifically designed for notebooks; you may find it useful.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"7. Build a pipeline: place key variable declarations at the top. Test with different parameters, clean up, and run all cells to prepare for potential non-interactive execution.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"8. Share and explain your data: if the original data are too big, inlude a sample. Make sure that the data is accessible. Include data description, and any processing done beforehand. Ideally, point to datasets that have been permanently managed and identified by DOIs.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"9. Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored:  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    9.1. Read: store it in a public code repository with a clear README file and a liberal open source license. Generate HTML/PDF versions of the final notebook.  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    9.2. Run: use Binder to run it in the cloud, and/or create a Docker image.  \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    9.3. Explore: use interactive widgets (e.g., ipywidgets, or panel) \\n\",\n",
    "    \"    \\n\",\n",
    "    \"10. Advocate for open research: ask your colleagues or friends to try to run your notebooks.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"__Additional recommendations, beyond the 10 rules:__\\n\",\n",
    "    \"1. Do not include shell commands in cells (unless the notebook will be distributed in Docker container.)\\n\",\n",
    "    \"2. Keep cell output if other researchers will use the included data, or clear cell output if they will use their own data.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"3. Develop your code in a clean virtual environment, to avoid dependency conflicts and streamline packaging.\\n\",\n",
